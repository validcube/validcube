### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

![I can speak natively in Thai!](https://img.shields.io/badge/I%20can%20speak%20natively%20in-Thai-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge "I can speak natively in Thai!")
![I can speak in English!](https://img.shields.io/badge/I%20can%20speak%20in-English-yellow?style=for-the-badge "I can speak in English!") 

My name is EvadeMaster on GitHub, and I'm a 14-year-old nerdy student from Thailand who started coding as a hobby. I began programming when I was nine, and I've always been fascinated by the world of computing. I first learned Lua on Roblox (which I still struggle with as of right now), then moved on to JavaScript and Python, and now I'm learning Kotlin and Dart. I enjoy making websites and applications more accessible to everyone, because there are people who use their devices differently than we do. In my free time, I also do graphic design and coding, and I like to contribute to projects.

I'm not fluent in English, but at least I tried!
