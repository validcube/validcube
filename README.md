### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

![I can speak natively in Thai!](https://img.shields.io/badge/I%20can%20speak%20natively%20in-Thai-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge "I can speak natively in Thai!")
![I can speak in English!](https://img.shields.io/badge/I%20can%20speak%20in-English-yellow?style=for-the-badge "I can speak in English!") 

My name is EvadeMaster on GitHub, a 14-year-old nerdy student from Thailand who started coding as a hobby! I started programming when I nine; I was always fascinated by the world of computing; I first learned Lua on Roblox ~~(which I still suck as of right now)~~ then JavaScript & Python, and now Kotlin & Dart! I like to make every website & application more accessible to everyone because there are people who use their devices not the same as us. I also do some graphic designing and coding during my free time, also contribute to the project!

I'm not fluent in English, but at least I tried!
