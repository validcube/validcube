### 👋 Hello there
My name is **Pun**; I'm a student and a maintainer of open-source software from Thailand.

I started my programming journey when I was 11 with [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), and as time went on, I began to explore more programming languages. Suddenly, I started doing [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), then [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

I have gathered decent experience in writing 🚀 general-purpose programs using Python and experience in 📱 mobile application development using Kotlin & Dart. 

Most of the time, I love to write 🎲 random programs—and, at the same time, contribute to 🌐 open-source projects.

I'm open to exploring more programming languages like C, Svelte and Rust to expand my skill set.

✨ Fun fact about me:
* I love to support older versions—I often find myself supporting a Python project down to Python 3.6 (why?);
* I love to express my creativity by drawing or illustrating (see my profile and [assets](https://github.com/validcube/validcube/tree/main/assets) used in Pull Request and banner!);
* My brain love hate talking to people, I often find myself getting random anxiety attacks when I speak to someone... whoops

This isn't a fun fact about me (this is probably every programmer ever): *why do manual work for 5 hours when you can spend 11 hours writing a program to do it for you*.

Also, don't be fooled by my English; I occasionally write the most incomprehensible sentences.
