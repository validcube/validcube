üëã Hello! My name is **Pun**, but I go by the name of **NullCube** on the internet. I'm a student from Thailand and an aspiring Open-Source software maintainer.

I started my programming journey when I was 11 with [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) on Roblox, and as time passed, I began to explore more programming languages. I started doing [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), then [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

My interests and expertise are vastly programming and art-related stuff like drawing (really badly), designing, writing general-purpose programs using Python and doing mobile application development using Kotlin & Dart. Most of my free time is spent on drawing, writing random programs‚Äîand, at the same time, contributing to Open-Source Projects for free if I'm bored I listen to music *or* might break applications/websites for fun.

I'm open to learning other programming languages like Svelte and Rust to expand my knowledge.

‚ú® Fun fact about me:
- This README is refreshed every year with new decorations and variations!
- Not really a fun fact, don't be fooled by my English; I occasionally write the most incomprehensible sentences.
- I love to express my creativity by drawing or illustrating (see my profile and [assets](https://github.com/validcube/validcube/tree/main/assets) used in Pull Request and banner!);
- *why do manual work for 5 hours when you can spend 11 hours writing a program to do it for you*.

Below here is a list of projects that I maintain or frequently contribute to.
